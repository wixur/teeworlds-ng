<p class="topic">WHAT IS THIS, THEN?</p>
<p>Teewars is a multiplayer 2D shooter, drawing its inspiration not only from
the old classics, but also incorporating the advancements that FPS games brought
in when the torch was handed over.</p>

<p>The game features 3D-accelerated sprite graphics, mouse-aiming, a grappling
hook, some rather weird weaponry and a built-in multiplayer server. You can play
it on Windows, MacOS X and any Linux flavor that can draw stuff on a screen.</p>

<p>More info about the game can be found under the support section.</p>
