<p>If you have trouble getting Teewars to run, experience performance problems or
have questions about the game, start out by checking our forums. Registration is free
(YA, RLY!) and no question is too dumb to search for.</p>

<p>There's also the IRC channel if you're feeling talkative, lonely or just want
to give us cake. Or bacon. We like bacon.</p>

<p>IRC: #teewars at irc.quakenet.org</p>
