With that being said, contact us if there is anything you want to do
that the license does not premit.

Why we have choosen this licens is because we want people to be able to
send in patches, bug-fixes and compile the game for their platform. We
don't want to have several diffrent versions floating around the net
with their own little features etc. There should only be one Teewars
and that one should be the very best it can be.
